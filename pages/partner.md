# Partner with Chicana por mi Raza
<br>

## Join the Collective
<br>
Since its inception, the Chicana por mi Raza Project has relied on the collective efforts of a group of researchers and teachers who are committed to unearthing the lessons of Chicana feminist praxis. The Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory Collective takes inspiration from the Chicana praxis it documents, re-envisioning the ARCHIVE as site of encuentro and exchange in which new “constituencies of resistance” (in Chela Sandoval’s words) are created and nurtured. Scholars, teachers and community members who wish to use the materials we have collected, are asked to commit to the project’s goals by joining the CPMR collective, and contributing to its continued survival and growth. Users may propose research projects and ways to improve the collection and its public website. Whether this work involves developing a class to collect oral histories, incorporating CPMR materials into lesson plans and class assignments, producing a “biocuration” or a short essay for our website, adding key descriptive information to a document in our repository, or simply correcting tags and other metadata—users of the archive are reminded that they are not mining a repository, but rather joining a network structured by the exchange of knowledge and conocimiento.

### Groups and Organizations
<br>
The Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory is always interested in developing new partnerships with organizations, libraries, research institutions and individuals who wish to collaborate in the collection and preservation of stories, archives, and written work documenting the development of Chicana feminist praxis in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
There are many avenues for potential collaboration. Community organizations with archival materials can work with local colleges and universities to conduct oral histories with elder members and scan their materials. Such projects can also be undertaken independently, without the assistance of local educational institutions. The Chicana por mi Raza Digital Collective has developed a set of guidelines, best practices, and work flows to help community organizations undertake their own histories, using the Chicana por mi Raza Digital collection as a repository for collected materials. If you would like to undertake a community history project, and are interested in working with us to make it happen, please contact the Project director: Dr. Maria Cotera

### Instructors
<br>
There are many ways for instructors to partner with the Chicana por mi Raza Digital Memory project—from developing courses and assignment structures using our materials, to creating content for our public website, to undertaking a local oral history/archival collection project as part of the class. The Chicana por mi Raza Digital Collective has developed a host of teaching materials to assist educators including course syllabi, reading lists, assignment structures, and guidelines for scanning, cataloging and working with the Medici System (our database). If you would like to use materials from our digital repository in your class, or even undertake a community history project, and are interested in working with us to make it happen, please contact the Project director: Dr. Maria Cotera
