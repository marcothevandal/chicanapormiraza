Married writer and artists José Antonio Burciaga in 1972. In 1974, Cecilia got a job at Stanford University and the couple moved to California. Over 23 years she held various positions at the university, including Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, Associate Provost for Faculty Affairs, and Assistant to the President as Director of the Office of Chicano Affairs.
